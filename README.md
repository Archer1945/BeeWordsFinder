# BeeWordsFinder
Find words that contain a specific set of letters. This project uses html and javascript to create a webpage allowing user input of letters that will be used to find all words containing those letters and only those letters.

I am a 75 year old retired IT guy and have been out of the business world for 10 years.  Since retirement I have tried to keep himself and my mind occupied and alert. I created this project as an exercise to help me and my wife who plays the NYT Spelling Bee game.  I had to brush up a bit on my html and learn Javascript, both have helped with keeping my mind active.
